<p>So I was very confused on why people were hyping this game up so much, and from what I can tell it&rsquo;s mainly because it&rsquo;s free. Even for a free VN, FLoDT isn&rsquo;t worth your time. There are way better free VNs that deserve your time, like Echo, Remember the Flowers, Adastra, etc. Though these are all furry VNs, I can&rsquo;t think of any good free anime VNs so I guess it makes more sense that people would drool over this game. But if you can&rsquo;t stand furry VNs then that&rsquo;s mainly your fault.</p>
